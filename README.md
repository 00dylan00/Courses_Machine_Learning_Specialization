# Machine Learning Specialization

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and resources for the Machine Learning Specialization I completed. This specialization is divided into three comprehensive courses, each focusing on different aspects of machine learning.

## Course Overview

### 1. Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification
- **Duration**: 33 hours
- **Description**: This course introduces the concepts of supervised learning, focusing on regression and classification techniques. Key topics include linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks.

### 2. Advanced Learning Algorithms
- **Duration**: 34 hours
- **Description**: Building upon the foundational knowledge, this course delves into advanced algorithms. Topics include ensemble methods, support vector machines, and advanced neural network architectures.

### 3. Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning
- **Duration**: 27 hours
- **Description**: This course explores unsupervised learning techniques, recommendation systems, and basics of reinforcement learning. Key areas of focus include clustering, dimensionality reduction, collaborative filtering, and Q-learning.

## Repository Structure

Each course has its own folder, containing Jupyter notebooks. The folders are organized as follows:

- `Course_1_Supervised_ML`
- `Course_2_Advanced_Algorithms`
- `Course_3_Unsupervised_RL`
